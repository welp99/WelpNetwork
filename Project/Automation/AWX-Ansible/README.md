## **Introduction to AWX**

AWX provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), which is a powerful IT automation tool. It is the upstream project for Red Hat Ansible Tower, a commercial derivative of AWX. AWX allows users to manage Ansible playbooks, inventories, and Schedule jobs to run using the web interface.

### **Key Features of AWX:**

- **Web Interface**: AWX offers a user-friendly web interface that makes it easy to manage and run Ansible playbooks. It provides a dashboard with insights into your automation environment, including recent job activity and system status.
- **REST API**: For those who prefer automation and integration with other services, AWX provides a REST API. This enables developers to programmatically manage their automation, integrate with other applications, or develop their own tools.
- **Task Engine**: At its core, AWX uses Ansible's task engine to handle automation jobs. This ensures that your automation is efficient, scalable, and reliable.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: AWX is designed to be scalable, allowing you to increase capacity as your automation needs grow. It also supports a wide range of environments and applications, providing the flexibility to tailor your automation.
- **Inventory Management**: AWX simplifies the process of managing your inventory, making it easy to group and organize hosts. It supports dynamic inventories from cloud sources such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and more.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: AWX includes RBAC, allowing administrators to set permissions based on roles for users and teams. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access and execute certain tasks.
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Automate your tasks by scheduling playbooks to run at specific times. This feature is perfect for routine automation, ensuring that your systems are updated, backed up, or checked for compliance regularly without manual intervention.
