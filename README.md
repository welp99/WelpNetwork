# **WelpNetwork**

Welcome to my GitHub repository, a central hub where I compile and share various projects I'm working on. This repository serves as a showcase for my explorations and accomplishments across different technology and computing domains, including automation, containerization, infrastructure management, and more.

## **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized into several folders, each focusing on a specific technology or area. Here's a brief overview:

### **Ansible**

This folder contains Ansible playbooks I've created for automating the configuration and management of infrastructure. The playbooks cover a range of tasks, from initial server setup to deploying specific services.

### **Docker**

In the Docker folder, you'll find all the Dockerfile files and configurations used to build Docker images. These images have been used to deploy applications and services in isolated, reproducible environments.

### **Kubernetes**

The Kubernetes folder includes Kubernetes manifests and other configuration files needed to deploy containers on a Kubernetes cluster. These files make it easier to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.

### **Scripts**

This folder hosts a collection of scripts I've written to automate various tasks and processes. The scripts span a wide range of languages and use cases, providing practical solutions to common problems.

### **Projects**

The Projects folder is dedicated to more extensive projects I've undertaken, covering areas such as cybersecurity, data science, and web development. Each project comes with its documentation, source code, and, where applicable, links to demos or live applications.

## **How to Use This Repository**

Each folder contains a specific README file that provides further details about its contents, including instructions on how to use or deploy them in your own projects.

## **Contributing**

I'm always open to contributions, suggestions, or feedback. If you have ideas or improvements to propose, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
